### WE ARE IN SHORT NEED OF GAME ARTISTS NOW!
We are looking for a talented game artist to join our team. Are you ready? \
We are just an indie game team, so you don't need to be hesitated if you have the intention of joining us!

## 2.The former name?
The game is formerly known as "Bird Flying Forward". \
For the future development, we chose to use "Blazing Interstellar Rush-Dash" instead of the former name.

## 3.I want to play the game. What kind of device should I use?
Maybe you need a keyboard (Your space-bar key should work well.) at present, so:
* A computer with a keyboard.
* A Laptop with a keyboard.
* A Tablet PC (iPad, etc.) with a keyboard.
* A Phone with a keyboard (lol)
Alright, alright, we are planning to make it adapt to touch screens.(LMAO)
